# Team Manager - Node.js

## Description

This is a project that uses Node.js to take user input about their team and create a website displaying the information. The user runs the code by entering node index into the command line. They are then prompted to answer questions about the team manager's name, id, email, and office number. They are then asked if they would like to add another employee. They can choose engineer, intern, or none. If they choose engineer or intern, and new set of basic info questions displays, and then the add new employee questions display again. If the user chooses "none," an html file called index.html is generated. This creates an html page that displays each team member in a card.

This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, and object oriented programming.
